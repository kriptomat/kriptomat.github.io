  <h2>True Weirdness</h2>
  <p>
    I am non-Dev humanalien with an enormous, innate, deep thirst for wisdom and with an eclectical knowledge 
    of the fabrics of the worlds we live in. Fell into the rabbit hole of blockchain in 2012, constructing the Exit ever since.
    Battling for the betterment of human experience on Earth and breaking stereotypes since 1991.
    My firm belief is that using the brain as a weapon, not just a tool, 
    is sometimes neccessary to upgrade our society. My first battleground is my studies - biopsychology, 
    my second is trance-formative dance experiences and my third is digital liberation/blockchain & Web3 - 
    all of this non-hierarchically. Let us share our Dreams and make them a Reality for All.
